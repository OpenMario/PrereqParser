In each area, students will identify the key developments and large issues at stake rather than merely acquiring information.","3",,"Not repeatable for credit",,,"Cannot enroll if classification is Freshman or Sophomore","false"

As the world increasingly globalizes, it becomes increasingly important to understand how countries outside the United States undertake the processes of detecting crime, labeling people “criminal,” and adjudicating criminal offenders. Is there a common threshold in other countries for determining guilt? Is there a universal standard that governs the presumption or guilt or innocence at the onset of the criminal justice process? How many other countries still use the death penalty? These are questions the course will address in addition to others related to policing, courts, and corrections.","3",,"Not repeatable for credit",,,,"false"

By the 1950s, Drexel was a powerhouse as a local provider of technical talent—and it became Drexel University in 1970. As the local economy went through a brutal deindustrial transformation Drexel had to change or face bankruptcy. The 1990s saw Drexel recovering and by the beginning of the new century Drexel evolved again in a period of change marked by the acquisition and founding of medical, nursing, public health schools, and law schools.","1",,"Not repeatable for credit",,,,"false"

Christianity is often considered to be diametrically opposed to Judaism, to be a rejection of the Judaic worldview. Indeed, prominent thinkers in the history of Christianity, such as Martin Luther, have reinforced this position. Yet Christianity was originally a development within Judaism, a sect, so to speak, of Judaism. The earliest Christians were Jewish followers of a Jewish leader and conceived of themselves as faithful Jews. So how did the two religions come to be viewed as opposed? Do elements of Judaism remain as part of the foundation of the new faith of Christianity? Where do the two faiths converge and where do they diverge? This course endeavors to answer these important questions.","3",,"Not repeatable for credit",,,,"false"

Jewish people have been vilified for denying the divinity of Jesus Christ; they were unjustly marked as murderers, usurers, and villains of all sorts; they were condemned for their supposed role in defiling and undermining the “white-race”; they were accused of committing the greatest abuses of capitalism, and at the same time, were charged with inventing socialism and Communism. What is antisemitism? How did it start? Why is it so enduring? This course will explore the long history of a perplexing and irrational phenomenon.

While the Pittsburgh, San Diego, and Newark shootings, and the Hanukkah attack in Monsey show are the most violent expressions of antisemitism that this country has ever seen, these are not the only times during which Jews were identified as outsiders and a threatening presence. This course will examine Jewish exclusion through the mid-20th century including General Grant’s expulsion of Jews, the Leo Frank lynching and Henry Ford’s Dearborn Independent, Father Coughlin’s antisemitic radio addresses, the Nazi rally and Madison Square Garden.

Jews were relegated to a marginalized group in Europe, but the New World opened up opportunities. They owned plantations and participated in extensive trading enterprises in the New World, including sugar cultivation, the triangulated slave trade, trade in precious gems, and the fur-trade.

Christianity is often considered to be diametrically opposed to Judaism, to be a rejection of the Judaic worldview. Indeed, prominent thinkers in the history of Christianity, such as Martin Luther, have reinforced this position. Yet Christianity was originally a development within Judaism, a sect, so to speak, of Judaism. The earliest Christians were Jewish followers of a Jewish leader and conceived of themselves as faithful Jews. So how did the two religions come to be viewed as opposed? Do elements of Judaism remain as part of the foundation of the new faith of Christianity? Where do the two faiths converge and where do they diverge? This course endeavors to answer these important questions.","3",,"Not repeatable for credit",,,,"false"
